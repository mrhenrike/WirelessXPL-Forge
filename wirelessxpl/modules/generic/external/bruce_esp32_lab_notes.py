"""Bruce/ESP32 Marauder firmware — lab integration notes (no flashing).

Bruce and ESP32 Marauder run on ESP32-class hardware for Wi‑Fi attacks,
wardriving-style recon, BLE scans and packet tooling. This module prints
authoritative links and a safe workflow; it does **not** bundle or flash firmware.
